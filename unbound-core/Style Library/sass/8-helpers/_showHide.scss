/*  SHOW HIDE
========================================================================== */

/*
 * Toggle visibility based on screen size
 * To use this feature just uncomment below and apply appropriate styles.
 * To cover all screen sizes can be pretty code heavy so leaving to your discretion.
 *
 * Utilizes mixin in Style Library/sass/base/mixins/_mq-visbility.scss
 *
 * !!Hope to formalize/modularize this more in future releases - EB
