/*

	Example of how to use matchMedia.
	The matchMedia legacy code has been removed, because this 
	funcitonality is now included in vanilla JavaScript.


	The below statement checks to see if 
	the screen is currently 500px or smaller.

	if ( window.matchMedia("(max-width: 500px)").matches ) {
		do something
	}
